# virtual_memory_simulator
Solution to the 2nd project of the "Computer Systems" course.


Problem Specification
---------------------

Implement a virtual memory simulator in C. In this simulator you will create
data structures and memory mapping mechanisms needed to paging. Moreover,
three page replacement algorithms have to be implemented: Not-­Recently-­Used
(NRU), Least-­Recently-Used (LRU) and a new algorithm proposed by you (NOVO).
